"""
Generate tool-calling SFT data for Mesosfer.

This dataset teaches the model to:
1. Recognize when a tool call is needed
2. Emit structured tool calls using <|python_start|> / <|python_end|> tokens
3. Incorporate tool output from <|output_start|> / <|output_end|> into its response
4. Refuse offensive tool usage (port scanning for attacks, etc.)

The tool-calling format uses mesosfer's existing special tokens:
  - <|python_start|>  code here  <|python_end|>   (model writes code to execute)
  - <|output_start|>  result here  <|output_end|>  (runtime returns result)

All examples use documentation-range IPs (203.0.113.x, 198.51.100.x) and
reserved domains (.example, .invalid, .test) to avoid real-world harm.
